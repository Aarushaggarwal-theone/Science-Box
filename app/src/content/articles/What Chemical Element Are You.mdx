## **Results**

### Mostly A’s: Carbon (C) – The Connector  
You’re the backbone of every friend group, just how carbon is the backbone of most organic compounds. You're the LINK in the chain, keeping things from falling apart, whether its friend groups or group projects. You can vibe with literally anyone \- from introverts, to overachivers, to the loud ones \- and can somehow make it work. You’re not loud about your presence, but everyone notices when you’re not around. You’re like the social glue holding everything together \- flexible, emotionally intelligent and reliable. 

Carbon atoms are in almost every compound that makes up life — organic molecules, proteins, DNA, even coffee. Not to make your head too big, but you're the foundation of everything living.

### Mostly B’s: Oxygen (O) – The Energizer  
That one friend who randomly wants to go hiking. Upbeat, active, and lively, you’re essential to the existence of your loved ones \- the human equivalent of a deep breath. You give life to everything you touch, and your energy is contagious \- you hype people up before exams, always spam texts (with emojis, of course) and always manage to bring people together. You’re perpetually positive, passionate and present \- people feel better just spending time with you. 

Oxygen fuels cellular respiration, and life on this plante is tied to oxygen \- its essential to our existence. Without it, cells literally shut down \- similar to the effect you have on people.

### Mostly C’s: Iron (Fe) – The Grounded Leader  
When the group chat’s in chaos, or when they just want someone who gets it, people come to you. You’re reliable, practical, and grounded. You’re probably lowkey protective, with older sibling energy, and secretly a softie under that stone-faced exterior. 

Iron strengthens buildings and bodies \- a vital component of our blood. It carries oxygen through the body, and is the reason things stand strong. Its a large component of the earths core \- the very foundation of life and our planet. 

### Mostly D’s: Helium (He) – The Lighthearted One  
You're chill, funny, and unpredictable. It's fun to be around you and you don't take life too seriously \- and people love that about you. You always know how to lift the mood, avoid unnecessary drama like its radioactive waste, and float through situations with ease. You’re the comic relief AND the main character at the same time. You probably have inside jokes with everyone. Your most common response to your friends’ trauma: “lol same”. 

Helium is a noble gas that doesn’t take place in most chemical reactions, due to its complete duplet. It's used to make balloons float, and gives your voice an unnaturally high, Alvin the chipmunk pitch when inhaled (though I would advise against doing so as it can be dangerous in excessive amounts) 

### Mostly E’s: Gold (Au) – The Rare Gem  
You have main character energy and you know it. Elegance meets authenticity when it comes to you, and you know your worth. You’re confident, thoughtful, kind, and people are a little obsessed with how put-together you are. Whether it’s academics, fashion, or relationships, you gracefully move with quiet confidence and purpose. And you love diamonds \- you have taste. 

Gold is an element found underground in the form of “ores”, from which it is extracted and purified to make jewellery, though that's not it's only use. Since its non-toxic and non-corrosive, it’s used in circuit boards for our phones and laptops, medical equipment, and even spacecrafts. It doesn't rust, fade or lost value \- its timeless, just like you.
